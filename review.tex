\begin{abstract} 

We review the relatively new, internet-enabled, and rapidly evolving field of
citizen science, focusing on ideas from which astronomy either has benefited, or
could benefit in the future. We consider contributions to science in the form of
observations, instrumentation, data processing, data modeling and the design of
new scientific inquiries. Engaging a large and diverse community of both
professionals and citizens, we digest and present their suggestions for ideas
for citizen astronomy in the future. The limits to this approach to scientific
investigation are not yet known, but we make some rough estimates for astronomy
in particular.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The term ``Citizen Science'' refers to the activities of people who are not paid
to carry out scientific research, but nevertheless make intellectual
contributions to scientific research in their spare time. These contributions
are diverse, both in type and research area. The people who make those
contributions can, and do, come from all walks of life. This review is about the
science projects they have participated in to date, the tasks they have
performed, and how astronomy has benefited -- and could benefit further -- from
their efforts.

Citizen involvement in science pre-dates the profession itself, and there is a long and honourable tradition of amateur observers making important discoveries and significant sustained contributions. However, the advent of the world wide web has changed the face of professional and amateur collaboration, providing new opportunities and accelerating the sharing of information. People are now connected to each other in a way that
has never happened before. Professional scientists can interact with citizens
via a range of web-based media, including purpose-built citizen science
websites which increase the potential for shared data analysis and exploration as well as data collection. Meanwhile, communities of citizens have sprung into existence as
like-minded people have been able to find and talk to each other in a way that
is almost independent of their geographical location. The result has been an
exponential increase in citizen involvement in science. The field is
evolving very quickly, with more and more professional scientists becoming aware
of the possibilities offered by collaborating with, for example, specialists
operating outside the usual parameters of professional astronomical observation,
or tens of thousands of people eager to perform analysis in their
lunch hours via microtasking.  Our aim in this review is to review the scientific literature as
it stands for ideas implemented in citizen science projects, primarily in
astronomy but also in other fields, and then produce a summary of successful
project characteristics for future research groups to learn from.

As our title states, this is a review of ideas for astronomy: we will look
forward as well as back, and try to answer the questions, How can the full
potential of citizen science be realised in astronomy? What are the particular
niches that citizen science can fill, in our field? How might it contribute to
the solutions of the Big Data problem in astronomy?

{\it Somewhat in the spirit of citizen science, we plan to crowd-source these
questions via a blog set up to accompany this article.  Each area we
cover will be opened up for discussion in the comments section, and we will
encourage the leading proponents to join in that discussion. Likewise, we will
encourage involvement from the citizens already working in astronomy, and the 
community of astronomers collaborating with them. The result will be an open
conversation which we will distill, with appropriate acknowledgment, into these
pages.}

This review is organised as follows. We survey the contributions to science that
citizens have made to date, organized according to the stage of the scientific
enquiry that those contributions fell into. Astronomy research typically starts
with observations: so do we, in \Sref{sec:obs}. We then proceed through a
discussion of citizen instrumentation, data processing, data modeling and
finally citizen-led enquiry in 
Sections~\ref{sec:instr}--\ref{sec:explore}. With this overview in place,
we review in \Sref{sec:crowd} the literature on, and the collected experience
of, the population of citizens who have taken part, or are currently taking
part, in scientific research, before summarizing progress in citizen science to
date in \Sref{sec:summary}. In the second part of this review, we turn to the
future. We first report a variety of suggestions for how
citizens might contribute to astronomy there in \Sref{sec:future}. Then, in 
\Sref{sec:limits} we consider possible limits to citizen science, including
challenges associated with data rates and volumes, data complexity, the
difficulties of large-scale collaboration, and finally the barriers to
accessibility. Finally, we give some concluding remarks in
\Sref{sec:conclusions}.

near-IR.
\item Visible-light and near-IR spectroscopy; long-term datasets, serious
photometry.  Calibration, calibration, calibration...
\item Advanced technologies such as AO for image stabilisation?
\end{itemize}

Adoption of uniform standards for amateur imaging to be provided to online
databases (already underway with PVOL).

\section{The Limits of Citizen Science}
\label{sec:limits}

We have argued that a critical part of `citizen science' lies in the ability of the amateur to make an authentic contribution to science. Earlier in this part of the review, we looked forward to a richer future for such interaction, but in this section we consider the potential limits and checks on citizen science.
