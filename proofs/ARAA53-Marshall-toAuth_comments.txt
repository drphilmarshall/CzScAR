Author Comments
===============

* Keywords: observations -- amateur astronomy -- visual inspection --
planetary science -- stellar variability -- galaxy morphology --
optical transients -- crowd-sourcing

* 2.1 - Keep (ISON) after C/2012 S1 to fit with rest of the comet
names.

* 2.1 - Can we update the mention of Siding Spring with Mars (provided
worldwide...)

* 2.3 - Something gone wrong with the edit - suggest '...between 2010
and 2012; their light curves have been used to determine...'

* 2.5 - not 'the ability to find charts' but 'produces finding charts'

* 2.9 - Lose colon ahead of 'For example, ecological'

* 2.9 - Amend to "Barentsen (private communication) was able"

* 3.1 - Suggested text :

Classification of data sets is not a new problem in astrophysics, and a
variety of projects have attempted to allow volunteers to make
significant contribution to the task. In this section, we review the
most prominent of such projects.

* 3.1.1. - BOSSA : Berkeley Open System for Skill Aggregation

* 3.1.2 - Not happy with 'was conducted by Willett et al'. Suggest 'is
included in Willett et al'

* 3.1.2 - Indentation seems to have gone wrong, here and elsewhere.
Suggest all text in sub-subsections be indented to match the rest of the article.

* 3.1.2 - Rix et al (2004) reference is:

* 3.1.3 Change the title to "Surfaces of Solar System Bodies: Moon Zoo and Moon
Mappers"

* 3.2 It's Simpson et al a. throughout this section

* 3.2 IBCC : independent Bayesian classifier combination

* It's OK to remove the header "Rare Event Detection..."
