My comments :

1. 2.1 - Keep (ISON) after C/2012 S1 to fit with rest of the comet 
names.

2. 2.1 - Can we update the mention of Siding Spring with Mars (provided 
worldwide...)

3. 2.3 - Something gone wrong with the edit - suggest '...between 2010 
and 2012; their light curves have been used to determine...'

4. 2.5 - not 'the ability to find charts' but 'produces finding charts'

5. 2.9 - Lose colon ahead of 'For example, ecological'

6. 2.9 - Was just Geert

7. 3.1 - Suggested text :

Classification of data sets is not a new problem in astrophysics, and a 
variety of projects have attempted to allow volunteers to make 
significant contribution to the task. In this section, we review the 
most prominent of such projects.

8. 3.1.1. - BOSSA : Berkeley Open System for Skill Aggregation

9. 3.1.2 - Not happy with 'was conducted by Willett et al'. Suggest 'is 
included in'

10. 3.1.3 Should the title mention Moon Mappers not Moon Watch?

11. 3.2 It's Simpson et al a. throughout this section

12. 3.2 IBCC : independent Bayesian classifier combination

13. Update SpaceWarps references! (Also in page 6.2)

14. 4.1 This section is Simpson et al.b

15. Holincheck et al : Probably should be Shamir, Holincheck & Wallin, 
Astronomy & Computing Volume 2, August 2013, Pages 67â€“73

16. Change citation to Kaggle competition: Should be Diedelman, Willett 
& Dambre, 2015MNRAS.450.1441D

17. Radio Galaxy Zoo paper nearly published...no references yet
